Choice: B

Explanation:
Both chapters do an effective job of teaching Java and object-oriented concepts through the use of astrophysical analogies. However, Assistant B's chapter is clearer and more accessible to someone new to these programming concepts. 

The explanations in Assistant B's chapter are more concise, and the formatting is slightly better in terms of breaking down different concepts such as static vs. instance methods and constructors. The removal of incorrect 'this' usage in one of the exercises adds clarity and prevents potential confusion about static and instance contexts.

Additionally, Assistant B provides clear examples and practical analogies, like using `public static void main(String[] args)` and command-line arguments, that are directly correlated with astrophysics applications. The structure of explanations in Assistant B's chapter helps build a stronger connection between the CS concepts and the astrophysics parallels, making it easier for someone with a keen interest in the latter to understand the former.
