# 32.2 Quick Select

Dissatisfied with the result that Quicksort is unable to completely defeat Mergesort and truly claim the title for "fastest comparison-based sorting" algorithm, let's shoot our one last shot to overturn the result: use Quick Select to identify the median.&#x20;

## Quick Select Algorithm

Goal: find the median using partioning.&#x20;

Key idea: Median of an length n array will be around index n /2.

1. Initialize array with the leftmost item as the pivot.&#x20;

For this example, the index of the median should be 9 / 2 = 4.&#x20;

2. Partition around pivot.&#x20;

Since the pivot is at index 2, which is not the median. Therefore, need to continue. However, will only partition the **right** subproblem because median can't be to the left! (index n/2 > 2)

3. Partition the subproblem. Repeat the process.

Pivot is at index 6, which means that it is not at the median. Continue.&#x20;

4. Stop when the pivot is at the median index.&#x20;

Since pivot is at index 4, we are done.&#x20;

## Quick Select Performance

### Worst Case Runtime

The worst case is when the array is in sorted order, which yields a runtime of $$\theta(N^2)$$.

### Expected Runtime

The expected runtime for the Quick Select Algorithm is $$\theta(N)$$. Here's an intuitive diagram that justifies this result:&#x20;

Using one of our favorite sums, we can see the runtime is:

$$
N + N/2 + N/4 +.... + 1 = \theta(N)
$$

## Compared to MergeSort?

Unfortunately, even using Quickselect to find the exact median, the resulting algorithm is still quite slow.&#x20;

Team Mergesort wins, sadly.&#x20;
