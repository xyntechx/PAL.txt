# 32.4 Summary

## Quicksort

What can we do to avoid the worst case runtime of $$\theta(N^2)$$ for Quicksort?&#x20;

1. Randomness: pick a random pivot point, shuffle items before sorting
2. Smarter Pivot Selection: constant time pivot pick (ex: pick a few and then choose the best out of them), linear time pivot pick like (ex: median)
3. Introspection: switch to a different sort if current sort hits recursion depth threshold

Quicksort vs. Mergesort

* Mergesort is faster than Quicksort L3S (leftmost pivot, 3-scan partition) and QuickSort PickTH (median pivot, Tony Hoare partition)
* Quicksort LTHS (leftmost pivot, Tony Hoare partition) is faster than Mergesort!
* Tony Hoare's partitioning:
  * two pointers, one at each end of the items array, walking towards each other
  * left pointer hates larger or equal items, right pointer hates smaller or equal items
  * swapping anything they donâ€™t like; stop when the two pointers cross each other
  * new pivot = Item at right pointer.

## Quick Select

Quick select helps us quickly find the median with partitioning. Median of an length n array will be around index n /2.&#x20;

1. Initialize array with the leftmost item as the pivot.&#x20;
2. Partition around pivot.&#x20;
3. Partition the subproblem. Repeat the process.
4. Stop when the pivot is at the median index.&#x20;

Expected runtime: $$\theta(N)$$. Worst case runtime (when array is in sorted order): $$\theta(N^2)$$.

## Stability, Adaptiveness, and Optimization

Stability: A sort is stable if the order of equivalent elements is preserved.

Optimizations:&#x20;

* Adaptiveness - sort that exploits the existing order of the array.
* Switch to Insertion Sort - when a subproblem reaches size 15 or lower
* Exploit restrictions on set of keys
* Switch from QuickSort - if the recursion goes too deep
