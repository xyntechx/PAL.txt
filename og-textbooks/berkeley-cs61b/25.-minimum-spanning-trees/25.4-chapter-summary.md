# 25.4 Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we learned about Minimum Spanning Trees and the Cut Property:

* **MST:** the lightest set of edges in a graph possible such that all the vertices are connected and acyclic.&#x20;
* **The Cut Property**: given any cut, the minimum weight crossing edge is in the MST.
  * _Cut_:  an assignment of a graphâ€™s nodes to two non-empty sets&#x20;
  * _Crossing Edge:_ an edge which connects a node from one set to a node from the other set.

We also learned about how to find MSTs of a graph with two algorithms:&#x20;

* **Prim's Algorithm**: Construct MST through a mechanism similar to Dijkstra's Algorithm, with the only difference of inserting vertices into the fringe not based on distance to goal vertex but distance to the MST under construction.&#x20;
  * _Runtime_: $$O((|V| + |E| )log(|V|))$$
* **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Construct MST by first sorting edges from lightest to heaviest, then add edges sequentially if no cycles are formed until there are V - 1 edges.
  * Runtime:&#x20;
    * $$O(|E| log |E|)$$ (unsorted edges)
    * $$O(|E| log* |V|)$$ (sorted edges)&#x20;
