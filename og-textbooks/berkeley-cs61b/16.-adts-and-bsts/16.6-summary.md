# 16.6 Summary

Abstract data types (ADTs) are defined in terms of operations, not implementation.Several useful ADTs:

* Disjoint Sets, Map, Set, List.
* Java provides Map, Set, List interfaces, along with several implementations.

We’ve seen two ways to implement a Set (or Map):

* ArraySet: Θ(N) operations in the worst case.
* BST: Θ(logN) operations if tree is balanced.

BST Implementations:

* Search and insert are straightforward (but insert is a little tricky).
* Deletion is more challenging. Typical approach is “Hibbard deletion”.
