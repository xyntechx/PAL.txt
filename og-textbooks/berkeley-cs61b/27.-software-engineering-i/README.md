# 27. Software Engineering I

Prior to the Fall 2023 semester, Professor Hug had a lecture about software code complexity.

For the Fall 2023 semester, this lecture was adjusted to have a similar form of content with different examples and real-world experiences that I (Aniruth) have been through on my gap year from Berkeley.

The content in this GitBook has been adjusted to the newest information. Both video recordings are linked below.
