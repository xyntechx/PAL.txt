# Classes, Methods, and Data Structures in Java

The cornerstone of object-oriented programming in Java lies in its use of classes, methods, and the manipulation of data through objects. Understanding the distinction between static and non-static methods is crucial, as static methods belong to the class itself, while non-static (or instance) methods pertain exclusively to an instance of that class. This chapter delves into these domains, exploring how classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, guiding you through the process of object instantiation, the role of constructors, and the nuances of instance variables. We'll further explore how class methods, which can be static, differ in usage compared to instance methods; a critical understanding needed when designing robust Java applications.

Additionally, we cover data structures such as arrays, focusing on their instantiation and utilization within Java. You'll learn how to create arrays of basic data types and complex arrays of objects, uncovering the wealth of possibilities they unlock for efficient data handling. Beyond this, the critical role of static variables within classes will be elaborated on. We will also demystify the ubiquitous `public static void main(String[] args)` method, a staple in Java programs that serves as the entry point, and how to leverage command line arguments for dynamic program execution. Lastly, we introduce the use of external Java libraries, enhancing your ability to expand your program's functionality beyond the core library offerings of the Java language.

## Static vs. Non-Static Methods

In computer science, the concept of static and non-static methods can be compared to certain phenomena in astrophysics, where some processes are independent of particular celestial objects, while others are required to occur in specific contexts. Static methods in Java programming function independently of any particular instance, similar to universal concepts in astrophysics, while non-static methods rely on specific instances in the same way certain processes depend on specific celestial bodies.

### Introduction to Static Methods with Example Code

In Java programming, a static method belongs to the class rather than any instance of the class. This is analogous to a universal law of physics, such as the law of gravity, which applies uniformly across the universe, regardless of which star or planet is being observed. For example, consider a utility method that calculates the gravitational force exerted by a celestial body, such as a star, which does not depend on any single star's specific instance but can calculate for any star given mass and distance.

```java
public class AstroCalculations {
    public static double calculateGravitationalForce(double mass, double distance) {
        final double gravitationalConstant = 6.67430e-11; // m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
        return (gravitationalConstant * mass) / (distance * distance);
    }
}
```

In this code, `calculateGravitationalForce` is a static method that operates the same across all stars and planets without needing to know any unique characteristics of a specific one.

### Explanation of Error When Running a Class Without a Main Method

Just like how you canâ€™t observe cosmic phenomena without having eyes or instruments to detect them, a Java application requires an entry point to run, which is the `main` method. If a class does not define this `main` method, attempting to execute that class will result in an error, similar to looking for black holes without a telescope.

```java
public class GalaxySimulation {
    // No main method here
}
// Error: Could not find or load main class GalaxySimulation
```

Without the `main` method, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) does not know where to start the interpretation, just as observers can't start their astronomical recording without instruments operated by observers.

### Example of a Client Class to Run Static Methods

In astrophysics, an observatory initiates the exploration and data gathering processes. Similarly, in Java, a client class or program operates the entire structure by calling static methods. For instance, consider the following client class which uses the calculation utility defined above.

```java
public class Observatory {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double massOfStar = 1.989e30; // mass in kg
        double distanceFromStar = 1.496e11; // distance in meters
        double force = AstroCalculations.calculateGravitationalForce(massOfStar, distanceFromStar);
        System.out.println("Gravitational Force: " + force + " Newtons");
    }
}
```

Here, `Observatory` acts like a telescope that utilizes `AstroCalculations` to calculate and print the gravitational force, demonstrating how static methods are invoked from another class, without requiring the instantiation of objects.

### Discussion on When to Use Main Method vs. Client Class

Just like how astronomers decide between telescopes based on the object being observed (e.g., radio telescope vs. optical telescope), Java developers make strategic decisions whether to use the `main` method directly or a separate client class. Use the `main` method method when implementing a standalone application, such as a simulation directly controlled by the program. However, when constructing a library of utilities, like astronomy calculation tools, it can be helpful to use a client class to separate calculations from control logic, providing a broader range of functionality like observing a cosmic event from an observatory station.

In conclusion, understanding the parallels between static and non-static methods in Java with universal astrophysical concepts can aid students in grasping these abstract CS concepts through a more familiar lens.

## Instance Variables and Object Instantiation

### Introduction to Instance Variables with Example Code
In computer science, an instance variable is akin to a unique signature for each celestial body in space. Consider each star in a galaxy; it has its own properties, like mass, luminosity, and temperature. Similarly, in programming, each object has its instance variables, which can be thought of as the core characteristics that define it.

Here is an example of a Java class representing a "Star," featuring instance variables:

```java
public class Star {
    private double mass; // mass of the star in solar masses
    private double luminosity; // luminosity of the star in solar units
    private double temperature; // surface temperature of the star in Kelvin

    public Star(double mass, double luminosity, double temperature) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.luminosity = luminosity;
        this.temperature = temperature;
    }
}
```

Each `Star` object instantiated from this class will have its own set of these properties, much like each star in the universe possesses unique attributes.

### Explanation of Object Instantiation and Instance Methods
In astrophysics, stars are born in stellar nurseries and evolve throughout their lifecycle, similar to how objects in programming are created and initialized. This process of creation is known as instantiation.

Upon instantiation, an object comes to existence with its specific characteristics defined by its instance variables. In Java, this is achieved through the `new` keyword and a constructor, which initializes the instance variables.

Continuing with our `Star` example:

```java
Star sun = new Star(1.0, 1.0, 5778); // Instantiating a Star object representing the Sun
```

Instance methods, akin to the interactions and processes that a star undergoes, allow these objects to perform actions or compute results based on their unique state. For instance, determining the star's life stage could be a method within this class:

```java
public String determineLifeStage() {
    if (mass < 0.08) {
        return "Brown Dwarf";
    } else if (mass < 1.4) {
        return "Main Sequence Star";
    } else {
        return "Giant Star";
    }
}
```

### Example of Using Instance Variables and Methods
Let's explore how these concepts play out by determining the life stage of a star using the `Star` class we defined:

```java
public class GalaxySimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star sirius = new Star(2.02, 25.4, 9940); // Sirius A attributes
        System.out.println("Sirius A is a " + sirius.determineLifeStage());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Star` object named `sirius` and call the `determineLifeStage` method to reveal its classification. Each star object operates independently and relies on its distinct attributes to determine outcomes just like stars enact their cosmic fates.

### Key Observations and Terminology Related to Objects and Instance Variables
- **Instance Variables**: These are equivalent to attribute sets that define each star, such as mass, brightness, and temperature. Each object of the class carries its unique set of these variables.
- **Object Instantiation**: This involves creating a unique cosmic entity, similar to forming a star that occupies its space with its own defining characteristics.
- **Instance Methods**: Think of these as universal laws or processes that guide the star's evolution, allowing objects to perform specific functions or transformations.

In essence, instance variables and object instantiation together form the backbone of programming at a level resembling the grand-scale organization of celestial objects in the universe.

## Constructors in Java

### Introduction to Constructors with Example Code
In the cosmic day-to-day operations of galaxies, stars are born, and systems forged through the vast chaos of space. Similarly, in the realm of Java programming, constructors are the cosmic architects crafting new instances of classes. Constructors in Java are special methods that share the class's name and do not return any value, not even void. They are the primordial spark that sets objects in motion, initializing their states.

For example, consider a `Galaxy` class, a representation of a sprawling star system. When we create a new `Galaxy`, its initial attributes such as size, type, or number of stars are defined through a constructor.

```java
public class Galaxy {
    private String type;
    private int numberOfStars;

    // Constructor
    public Galaxy() {
        this.type = "Spiral";
        this.numberOfStars = 1000000000;
    }

    // Method to display galaxy details
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Galaxy Type: " + type);
        System.out.println("Number of Stars: " + numberOfStars);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Galaxy milkyWay = new Galaxy();
        milkyWay.display();
    }
}
```

This snippet illustrates the birth of a `Galaxy` object, much like a stellar nursery giving rise to new celestial bodies.

### Explanation of Parameterized Instantiation
In the expansive universe, no two galaxies are exactly alike; similarly, constructors can be parameterized to create objects with distinct characteristics. This flexibility allows programmers to define multiple constructors with different parameters, enabling nuanced and precise object instantiation.

For example, if you desire to create a galaxy explicitly defined as an elliptical galaxy with a unique count of stars:

```java
public class Galaxy {
    private String type;
    private int numberOfStars;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Galaxy(String type, int numberOfStars) {
        this.type = type;
        this.numberOfStars = numberOfStars;
    }

    // Method to display galaxy details
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Galaxy Type: " + type);
        System.out.println("Number of Stars: " + numberOfStars);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Galaxy andromeda = new Galaxy("Elliptical", 2000000000);
        andromeda.display();
    }
}
```

This parameterized instantiation is akin to a cosmic artisan molding galaxies, accommodating the diversity and complexity found in the universe.

### Comparison to Python's `__init__` Method
Just as different cosmic observations can be made about celestial objects from different perspectives, when transitioning to Python, constructors are initialized using the `__init__` method, offering a different but powerful paradigm. Unlike Java where method names are distinct for each class as constructors, Python uses a universal keyword to initialize a newly created object.

Consider the same galaxy example implemented in Python:

```python
class Galaxy:
    def __init__(self, type="Spiral", number_of_stars=1000000000):
        self.type = type
        self.number_of_stars = number_of_stars

    def display(self):
        print(f"Galaxy Type: {self.type}")
        print(f"Number of Stars: {self.number_of_stars}")

milky_way = Galaxy()
milky_way.display()

andromeda = Galaxy("Elliptical", 2000000000)
andromeda.display()
```

Here, the `__init__` method is Python's cosmological constant, defining how galaxiesâ€”or objectsâ€”are initialized within the Python universe. Although Python's and Javaâ€™s constructors operate under different rules, they both serve the comparable purpose of bringing class instances into existence with initial conditions, like new stars igniting across the cosmos.

## Array Instantiation

In computer science, when we talk about arrays, we're referring to a structured collection of elements, akin to a series of star systems in the vast expanse of a galaxy, each organized in a specific sequence. In astrophysics, just as we might chart a linear path through stars or planets, an array allows us to maintain orderly access to data points or objects.

### Introduction to array instantiation with example code

In Java, we create an array to store a sequence of elements of a specific type, much like cataloging celestial bodies of the same type such as planets or stars in a syntactic constellation. Instantiating an array is akin to plotting these stellar objects along a predetermined trajectory, ensuring that each one's position is accessible by its index, similar to how astronomers use coordinates to locate a star. Here's how you might instantiate an array in Java:

```java
// Instantiate an array to represent the brightness levels of stars
int[] starBrightnessLevels = new int[10];
```

In this example, `starBrightnessLevels` array acts much like a telescope that points to each star along the path, with its `int[10]` reflecting the capacity to handle 10 data points, just as an astronomer might examine ten stars in a specific segment of the universe.

### Example of arrays of objects

In arrays of objects, each element in the array represents an instance, much like addressing each planet in a solar system for study. Imagine every object in the array being a unique planet with its own attributes, such as mass, orbit, or elemental composition. By creating an array of such objects, we can organize these planetary bodies for comprehensive analysis and comparison.

```java
// Define a class to represent a Planet
class Planet {
    String name;
    double mass;
    double diameter;
    // Constructor and other members
}

// Instantiate an array of Planets
Planet[] galaxyPlanets = new Planet[5];
```

In this snippet, `galaxyPlanets` is an array that can hold reference to `Planet` objects, similar to collating information for five planets within a solar system. Each index in the array can be seen as a distinct planet providing us detailed insights into different planetary phenomena.

### Explanation of using 'new' keyword for arrays and objects

The `new` keyword in Java is a powerful incantation that brings to life both arrays and the objects they might contain. It's analogous to constructing observatories in carefully chosen locales to observe cosmic events. When creating either an array or its associated objects, `new` reserves memory space in the vast digital expanseâ€”similar to marking a stellar region on a celestial chart.

With arrays, `new` establishes a space for a sequence of elements, much like setting up a series of observatories that may eventually house specific data on celestial bodies:

```java
// Create a new instance of a Planet object
planetArray[0] = new Planet();
```

Here, using `new Planet();` generates a fresh storage domain for a planetary bodyâ€™s data, akin to deploying a new satellite to gather information about a newly discovered planet in a candidate star system.

Thus, the act of instantiation links computational techniques in computer science to structural discovery in astrophysics, enabling keen observation and management of intricate systems, whether of algorithms or stellar bodies.

## Class Methods vs. Instance Methods

In the study of computer science, particularly in object-oriented programming, we often come across the concepts of class methods (often referred to as static methods) and instance methods (non-static methods). These are ways to encapsulate behaviors within classes, similar to how astrophysicists group celestial phenomena based on their characteristicsâ€”whether they are core attributes inherent to the universe itself or specific events unique to individual celestial bodies.

### Understanding the Galactic Dance: Static vs. Instance Methods

Just as the laws of physics apply universally to every star and planet, class methods can be thought of as behaviors that belong to the class itself rather than any one object. On the other hand, instance methods are like the unique movements and characteristics of a spinning neutron star; they pertain to a specific instance of a class.

Let's translate these ideas into a space-related context using Java:

```java
class Star {
    // Static method representing a universal law
    static double gravitationalConstant() {
        return 6.67430e-11; // Newton's constant in m3 kgâˆ’1 sâˆ’2
    }
    
    // Non-static method representing individual star attributes
    double luminosity(double radius, double temperature) {
        // A formula derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann Law
        return 4 * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2) * Math.pow(temperature, 4);
    }
}
```

### Calculating Universal Dynamics: Static Methods

Static methods embody principles or constants that apply universally across all instances much like the gravitational constant in astrophysics. These methods are invoked directly on the class without needing an instance:

```java
public class SpaceExploration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Static method call
        System.out.println("Gravitational Constant: " + Star.gravitationalConstant());
    }
}
```

This is akin to calculating the gravitational interactions in any star system using a constant that applies throughout the cosmos.

### Customizing Star Systems: Static and Non-Static Methods in Play

In addition to universal truths, certain calculations and interactions are specific to individual celestial bodies, much like how you might analyze the temperature and luminosity of a specific star. Instance methods represent these unique attributes.

Hereâ€™s an illustrative Java class representing these ideas in astrophysics:

```java
class Galaxy {
    double mass;
    double velocity;
    
    // Static method: much like understanding the overall rotation curve of galaxies
    static double hubbleConstant() {
        return 70.0; // in km/s/Mpc
    }
    
    // Instance method: much like calculating a specific galaxy's rotation
    double kineticEnergy() {
        return 0.5 * mass * Math.pow(velocity, 2);
    }
}
```

### When to Orbit with Static vs. Non-Static Methods

Deciding when to use a static versus a non-static method is like choosing which astrophysical laws to apply universally versus those suited for a particular event or object setting. Use static methods for behaviors or calculations that remain the same across all instances, such as the calculation of cosmic background radiation. For actions or properties specific to an individual star or galactic body, non-static methods are appropriate.

Static methods are ideal for shared functionalities or utilities, simplifying calculations based on consistent cosmic laws. Opt for instance methods when different entities, like various stars or galaxies, possess unique properties or require tailored calculations reflecting their distinct characteristics.

This blend of universal and specific methodologies mirrors the complexities faced in astrophysics, demonstrating the structural elegance and practical design inherent in object-oriented programming.

## Static Variables in Astrophysics Context

In computer science, static variables are akin to fundamental constants of the universe in astrophysics. These variables hold a fixed place across different instances, much like how constants like the speed of light or gravitational constant remain consistent, governing the mechanics of cosmic phenomena regardless of the celestial bodies involved.

### Introduction to Static Variables with Example Code

Static variables in programming are variables declared in a class with the `static` keyword and are shared among all instances of that class, much like how Planck's constant or the gravitational constant is universal across various cosmic objects. Once a static variable is initialized, it retains its value and can be accessed from any instance of the class.

Here's an example in Java that demonstrates static variables using a celestial analogy:

```java
public class CosmicParticle {
    // Static variable representing a universal constant
    private static double speedOfLight = 299792458; // in meters per second
    
    private String particleName;
    private double particleSpeed;

    public CosmicParticle(String name, double speed) {
        this.particleName = name;
        this.particleSpeed = speed;
    }

    public void displayParticleInfo() {
        System.out.println("Particle: " + particleName + ", Speed: " + particleSpeed + ", Speed of Light: " + speedOfLight);
    }
}
```

In this code, `speedOfLight` is a static variable, representing how certain values like the speed of light affect all particles in the universe equally.

### Explanation of Accessing Static Variables Using Class Name

Static variables can be accessed directly using the class name, much like how in astrophysics, constants like the gravitational constant do not need reference from individual celestial bodies but are universal values.

In our example, if you wanted to reference the speed of light independently of any `CosmicParticle` object, you would do:

```java
System.out.println("Speed of Light: " + CosmicParticle.speedOfLight);
```

This mimics how constants remain accessible without needing any object, linking back to the fundamental underpinnings of the universe's structure that govern various cosmic phenomena.

### Discussion on Style and Best Practices

In the same way that careful measurements and standards are crucial in astrophysics for precise observations and experiments, maintaining clarity and uniformity in using static variables promotes code readability and maintainability. It is a best practice to access these variables directly through the class (like `CosmicParticle.speedOfLight`) to ensure clear documentation of their constant nature analogous to immutable cosmic laws.

Also, thoughtful naming of static variables helps keep them as understandable as universal constants, ensuring that their significance is immediately comprehensible to anyone delving into the cosmic code universe, much like how `G` or `c` are universally recognized in physics for gravitational constant and speed of light, respectively.

## The Main Method in Java

In the vast universe of Java programming, the main method acts like the pivotal center of our program, akin to the central hub of a bustling space station. It is the entry point where our program starts, much like the beginning of a journey through space.

### Understanding the Declaration

In astrophysical terms, declaring the main method is similar to setting up a mission control center for a space operation. It gathers all necessary components to ensure a successful mission launch. 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Mission operations commence here
}
```

- **public**: This keyword is like a signal that a new cosmic mission is available for all to see and join. Just as a public space observatory allows anyone to observe the stars, making the main method public ensures it can be launched from anywhere.
- **static**: Consider this as a constant element in our cosmic operation, much like the constant pull of gravity. Being static means that it belongs to the class as a whole and doesnâ€™t require any specific instance of the class. When initiating our mission, this method will be executed uniformly across the universe of the Java application.
- **void**: Just as some space missions are exploratory without the intent of retrieving samples, the void keyword indicates that our mission will not return any data back to its origin.
- **main**: This is our mission name. Unlike variable space expeditions, the name "main" is universally recognized across the Java galaxy as the designated start point.

### Essential Components of the Main Method

Each part of this method is as essential to our program as different components of a space shuttle are to a space mission.

- **Method Signature**: Comparable to a spacecraft's unique design, the signature defines the mission's blueprint. This includes the combination of access modifiers, the return type, name, and parameters.
- **Method Body**: The enclosed section between curly braces acts as the mission's command center, where each program instruction is an operator in control, akin to the team executing a series of maneuvers in space.

### Launching with Command Line Arguments

Imagine providing a mission crew with a set of initial coordinates and instructions for their space journey. Command line arguments serve this kind of purpose in Java, supplying the main method with external information necessary to perform its tasks.

In our cosmic terms, these arguments are like parameters dictating the spacecraft's orientation or speed settings derived from data external to the preloaded mission plan.

Here's how you might start a mission, utilizing these arguments:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (args.length > 0) {
        System.out.println("Destination coordinates set to: " + args[0]);
    } else {
        System.out.println("No destination coordinates provided.");
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the mission control center (main method) checks if any coordinates (arguments) were provided. If they were, it acknowledges them, much as a space agency would confirm receipt of a new course setting; otherwise, it warns that no new instructions have been received. This interstellar approach makes adapting to new conditions a seamless experience.

## Command Line Arguments and the Cosmic Universe

Command line arguments may seem like an abstract computer science concept, but they can be vividly related to phenomena in astrophysics. Just as celestial objects interact with their environment in the cosmos, command line arguments interact with programs in the computational realm.

### How Command Line Arguments are Like Space Probes Communicating with Mission Control

In astrophysics, think of command line arguments as onboard commands sent to a space probe from mission control. These commands might instruct the probe to adjust its trajectory, change its sensor settings, or perform calculations. Similarly, command line arguments in a program provide it with inputs to adjust its behavior.

For example, consider the following Java program that simulates how a space probe might interpret command line arguments:

```java
public class SpaceProbe {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Initiating system procedures for " + args[0]);
            // Further process each command to execute specific space probe tasks
        } else {
            System.out.println("Waiting for further commands from mission control.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, if we run this program from the command line with arguments such as `MarsLanding`, the probe will read this command and start its specific procedures for the landing.

### Summing Up Cosmic Energies: An Example with Command Line Arguments

Now, let's explore an example where command line arguments are akin to calculating the total gravitational pull on celestial bodies in a galaxy. Just as you would total up forces from multiple stars exerting influence on a planet, you might want to sum numeric command line arguments to achieve a meaningful result.

Here is a Java code snippet demonstrating this concept:

```java
public class GravitationalSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double totalForce = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
            totalForce += Double.parseDouble(args[i]);
        }
        System.out.println("Total gravitational force acting is: " + totalForce + " N");
    }
}
```

In our cosmic program, each command line argument represents a gravitational pull from a different celestial object, outlined in Newtons (N). When you provide these as arguments, the program calculates and displays the total gravitational force at play, simulating the complexity of planetary dynamics in a galaxy.

Command line arguments are an essential part of communicating with our programs just as mission control communicates with space probes. By understanding and leveraging them, you not only write more flexible and interactive software but also enhance your program's ability to process complex data inputs, much like how space missions adapt to their cosmic journeys.

## Using Libraries

In the realm of computer science, using libraries is akin to how astrophysicists routinely utilize data generated by space telescopes and simulations. Libraries in CS provide pre-written code, similar to how astrophysics datasets give researchers access to a vast repository of pre-collected data, allowing them to focus on analysis rather than data collection from scratch.

### Discussion on finding and using existing libraries

Just as an astronomer might look for existing datasets from the Hubble Space Telescope or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to further their research, programmers can search for existing libraries to incorporate into their projects. Astrophysicists donâ€™t always reinvent the wheel; they use existing theoretical models and data analysis tools built by others, because this allows them to stand on the shoulders of giants and advance their work more efficiently. Similarly, code libraries contain functions and methods that reduce the need to write everything from the ground up, offering well-tested and optimized capabilities for immediate use.

For instance, in programming, if you wish to compute complex orbital mechanics for a satellite, you might turn to a library that already contains physics calculation routines. Here's a simple Java example using a hypothetical astrophysics library:

```java
import astrophysics.OrbitalMechanics;

public class SatelliteSimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrbitalMechanics orbit = new OrbitalMechanics();
        double velocity = orbit.computeOrbitalVelocity(7000, 5.972E24);
        System.out.println("Orbital Velocity: " + velocity + " m/s");
    }
}
```

In this snippet, `OrbitalMechanics` is a library that handles complex calculations, just as astronomers might use existing software to analyze cosmic phenomena without manually handling all underlying physics computations.

### Guidelines and caveats for using libraries in coursework

When employing libraries, much like how astrophysicists cite their data sources, computer science students should not only acknowledge but also thoroughly understand the components they are using. Using libraries without comprehension is akin to an astrophysicist interpreting cosmic background radiation data without understanding the principles behind it.

For a successful implementation, students should ensure:

- **Relevance:** Libraries must fit the purpose of the task, just as data needs to be relevant to the hypothesis an astrophysicist aims to test.
- **Documentation:** Much like scholarly articles help scientists understand methods used in previous research, library documentation must be read and understood.
- **Dependencies:** One should be aware of any library dependencies, akin to understanding the conditions and limitations of astrophysical models.
- **Learning Opportunity:** Libraries should be used as a learning tool. Understand their functioning, much like how reviewing simulation models helps astrophysicists grasp the underlying physical laws better.

After incorporating a library, always validate that it integrates well with the remaining components of your project, comparable to cross-validating theoretical predictions with observational data in astronomy.
