# Evaluation category: All CS concepts from the reference chapter have been accurately explained

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The modified chapter accurately captured all the CS concepts from the reference chapter. It maintains the essence of static vs. non-static methods, instance variables, object instantiation, constructors, and more. The content is still intrinsically linked to its CS roots, even with the Dragon Ball themed overlay.

# Evaluation category: The dragon ball concepts are sufficiently used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: Dragon Ball concepts are creatively and sufficiently integrated throughout the modified chapter. The chapter uses dragon ball analogies to explain classes, methods, and other object-oriented principles effectively, referencing Saiyan power levels and Dragon Ball character names to illustrate points.

# Evaluation category: The dragon ball concepts are accurately used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The use of Dragon Ball concepts is accurate. The references to Saiyan power levels, Kamehameha technique, and other Dragon Ball universe elements are correctly applied in context and relate well to the CS principles being explained, enhancing the reader's engagement without misrepresenting the original DBZ concepts.

# Evaluation category: The dragon ball concepts do not overshadow the CS concepts (the main subject to be taught is CS)

Score: 2/3

Feedback: While Dragon Ball concepts are heavily used, they do not completely overshadow the CS concepts. However, there's a risk that the thematic elements might occasionally distract readers from the CS content. The main subject remains CS, but some audiences might find the theme a bit dominating at times.
