The AI assistant skillfully integrated microeconomics concepts to explain computer science principles, enriching the educational content. By providing economic analogies and terminologies, it enhanced the understanding of static vs. non-static methods, instance methods, object instantiation, and more. The balance was well maintained, ensuring that the economics elements facilitated rather than overshadowed the primary teaching of CS concepts. I appreciate how the economic context provided fresh perspectives on standard CS ideas, though some readers might wish for a clearer separation between the two disciplines for simplicity.
