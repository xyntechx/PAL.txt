# 2. Defining and Using Classes

If you do not have prior Java experience, we recommend that you work through the exercises in [HW0](http://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw0/hw0.html) before reading this chapter. It will cover various syntax issues that we will not discuss in the book.

#### Static vs. Non-Static Methods <a href="#static-vs-non-static-methods" id="static-vs-non-static-methods"></a>

**Static Methods**

All code in Java must be part of a class (or something similar to a class, which we'll learn about later). Most code is written inside of methods. Let's consider an example from the realm of astrophysics:

```java
public class Star {
    public static void emitLight() {
        System.out.println("Shine Bright!");
    }
}
```

If we try running the `Star` class, we'll simply get an error message:

```
$ java Star
Error: Main method not found in class Star, please define the main method as:
       public static void main(String[] args)
```

The `Star` class we've defined doesn't do anything on its own. We've simply defined something that a `Star` **can** do, namely emit light. To actually run the class, we'd either need to add a main method to the `Star` class, as we saw in chapter 1.1, or we could create a separate [`StarLauncher`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-LE-jJQLTM) class that runs methods from the `Star` class. For example, consider the program below:

```java
public class StarLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star.emitLight();
    }
}
```

```
$ java StarLauncher
Shine Bright!
```

A class that uses another class is sometimes called a "client" of that class, i.e. `StarLauncher` is a client of `Star`. Neither of the two techniques is better: Adding a main method to `Star` may be better in some situations, and creating a client class like `StarLauncher` may be better in others. The relative advantages of each approach will become clear as we gain additional practice throughout the course.

When talking about static and non-static methods in computer science, particularly in object-oriented programming, you can draw interesting parallels to concepts in astrophysics to make them easier to understand.

Consider a galaxy full of stars, planets, and possibly other entities. Imagine that this entire galaxy represents a class in programming, which is like a blueprint for creating various space objects. Within this galaxy, you could think of different methods as functions that describe behaviors or actions for stars, planets, etc.

Now, a static method in programming is like a universal law or principle that applies to the entire galaxy. It doesn't require any individual star or planet to exist for it to function. For instance, think of something akin to the law of gravity, which affects every entity in the galaxy, but doesn't require a specific planet to demonstrate its effect. In programming terms, a static method can be called on the class itself without needing an instance (or individual object) of the class.

In contrast, a non-static method is more like a unique characteristic or behavior that belongs to individual celestial bodies within that galaxy, such as the rotational period of a specific planet or the brightness of a particular star. To understand or use these characteristics, you must have a specific planet or star in mind. Hence, in a programming context, a non-static method requires you to create an object (or an instance of the class) to call the method. It's very much individual-object specific, just like how orbital paths are specific to planets.

So, while static methods offer a broad, class-level functionality, much like immutable laws of physics, non-static methods provide object-level, instance-specific operations that allow for nuanced and unique interactions, just as the diverse behaviors of astronomical objects do within their vast galactic home.

**Instance Variables and Object Instantiation**

Not all stars are alike. Some stars emit a gentle glow, while others blaze intensely, illuminating the cosmos with their radiant energy. Often, we write programs to mimic features of the universe we inhabit, and Java's syntax was crafted to easily allow such mimicry.

One approach to allowing us to represent the spectrum of stardom would be to create separate classes for each type of Star.

```java
public class DwarfStar {
    public static void emitLight() {
        System.out.println("gentle glow...");
    }
}

public class GiantStar {
    public static void emitLight() {
        System.out.println("blazing intensely!");
    }
}
```

As you should have seen in the past, classes can be instantiated, and instances can hold data. This leads to a more natural approach, where we create instances of the `Star` class and make the behavior of the `Star` methods contingent upon the properties of the specific `Star`. To make this more concrete, consider the class below:

```java
public class Star {
    public double luminosity;

    public void emitLight() {
        if (luminosity < 1.0) {
            System.out.println("gentle glow...");
        } else if (luminosity < 10.0) {
            System.out.println("radiate...");
        } else {
            System.out.println("blazing intensely!");
        }
    }    
}
```

As an example of using such a Star, consider:

```java
public class StarLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star s;
        s = new Star();
        s.luminosity = 5.0;
        s.emitLight();
    }
}
```

When run, this program will create a `Star` with luminosity 5.0, and that `Star` will soon radiate with appropriate intensity.

Some key observations and terminology:

* An `Object` in Java is an instance of any class.
* The `Star` class has its own variables, also known as _instance variables_ or _non-static variables_. These must be declared inside the class, unlike languages like Python or Matlab, where new variables can be added at runtime.
* The method that we created in the `Star` class did not have the `static` keyword. We call such methods _instance methods_ or _non-static methods_.
* To call the `emitLight` method, we had to first _instantiate_ a `Star` using the `new` keyword, and then make a specific `Star` shine. In other words, we called `s.emitLight()` instead of `Star.emitLight()`.
* Once an object has been instantiated, it can be _assigned_ to a _declared_ variable of the appropriate type, e.g. `s = new Star();`
* Variables and methods of a class are also called _members_ of a class.
* Members of a class are accessed using _dot notation_.

Imagine you're observing galaxies through a telescope. Each galaxy is unique, with its own mass, velocity, number of stars, and other characteristics. In the world of programming, you could think of each galaxy as an "object," and these unique characteristics as "instance variables."

In computer science, particularly in object-oriented programming, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (the blueprint for creating objects) for which every instantiated object has its own separate copy. Similarly, in our galaxy example, if a "Galaxy" class were to exist in a software, it might include instance variables such as `mass`, `velocity`, `numberOfStars`, among others. Each galaxy you observe could be a distinct "instance" of this class, having specific values for each of these variables based on its observed properties.

Object instantiation is the process of creating a specific object from a class. When you point your telescope at a new galaxy, it's akin to the process of instantiation in programming—you are "creating" an object in your observational data with its own set of instance variables to store the unique data of that galaxy.

Just like in astrophysics, where each galaxy operates according to the universal laws of physics but manifests them uniquely due to its characteristics, in programming, each instance of an object operates according to the logic defined in the class but through its own unique instance variables. This allows programmers to model complex systems in a manageable way, just as observational data allows astrophysicists to understand the universe one galaxy at a time.

**Constructors in Java**

As you've hopefully seen before, we usually construct objects in object oriented languages using a _constructor_:

```java
public class StarLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star s = new Star(5.0);
        s.emitLight();
    }
}
```

Here, the instantiation is parameterized, saving us the time and messiness of manually typing out potentially many instance variable assignments. To enable such syntax, we need only add a "constructor" to our Star class, as shown below:

```java
public class Star {
    public double luminosity;

    public Star(double l) {
        luminosity = l;
    }

    public void emitLight() {
        if (luminosity < 1.0) {
            System.out.println("gentle glow...");
        } else if (luminosity < 10.0) {
            System.out.println("radiate...");
        } else {
            System.out.println("blazing intensely!");
        }    
    }
}
```

The constructor with signature `public Star(double l)` will be invoked anytime that we try to create a `Star` using the `new` keyword and a single double parameter. For those of you coming from Python, the constructor is very similar to the `__init__` method.

**Terminology Summary**

Imagine you're an astrophysicist working on constructing a model of a new solar system. For each planet you create, you'd need to specify various characteristics like its size, mass, distance from the star, and orbital speed—similar to how you define attributes in a model.

In the programming world, especially in Java, constructors serve a similar purpose. They are special methods used to create and initialize objects from a class. When we talk about constructors in Java, think of them as the initial blueprints for our "celestial models." Just as you might have different requirements for simulating various planets, constructors allow you to set initial parameters for different objects upon their creation.

For example, if you're simulating planets, you might have a class called `Planet` that has attributes like `mass`, `radius`, and `orbitalVelocity`. When you create an instance of this `Planet` class, a constructor can be used to specify the initial values of these attributes. 

Much like how you might have one standard set of initial conditions for modeling Earth-like planets and another for gas giants, in Java, you can have multiple constructors within the same class to handle different scenarios. This is called constructor overloading, where you have different constructors with varying parameters to handle different initial setups when objects are created.

In essence, constructors in Java allow programmers to define starting points for their objects, similar to how you would set initial conditions in a simulation of planetary systems. As you delve deeper into object-oriented programming, you'll see how constructors are crucial for carefully crafting new "celestial bodies" in the form of objects, each with their unique properties and behaviors.

**Array Instantiation, Arrays of Objects**

As we saw in HW0, arrays are also instantiated in Java using the new keyword. For example:

```java
public class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Create an array of five celestial temperatures. */
        double[] temperatures = new double[5];
        temperatures[0] = 5000.0;
        temperatures[1] = 6500.0;
    }
}
```

Similarly, we can create arrays of instantiated objects in Java, e.g.

```java
public class StarArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Create an array of two stars. */
        Star[] stars = new Star[2];
        stars[0] = new Star(0.5);
        stars[1] = new Star(15.0);

        /* Gentle glow will result, since stars[0] has low luminosity. */
        stars[0].emitLight();
    }
}
```

Observe that `new` is used in two different ways: Once to create an array that can hold two `Star` objects, and twice to create each actual `Star`.

Arrays are a fundamental concept in computer science that can be particularly useful when managing and organizing large datasets, which is often necessary in astrophysics to handle data from telescopes or simulations. Let's explore how array instantiation and arrays of objects can be applied to astrophysics.

An array is essentially a collection of elements, all of which are of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They allow for the efficient access and manipulation of data, which is crucial when dealing with the vast amounts of information generated by astronomical observations. For example, you might use an array to store the brightness values of stars in a particular region of the sky.

When we talk about array instantiation, we're referring to the process of creating an array in memory. In programming, this often involves specifying the size of the array and sometimes initializing it with default values. For instance, if you're analyzing the position of stars within a given cluster, you might create an array to hold their coordinates in three dimensions.

Arrays of objects take this concept a step further by enabling you to store complex data structures rather than just simple data types (like integers or floats). In the context of astrophysics, each object in an array might represent a celestial body, complete with attributes such as mass, velocity, and luminosity. This approach allows one to effectively manage and manipulate detailed datasets where each element (or object) has multiple associated properties, akin to how one might deal with multiple characteristics of galaxies or stars.

Therefore, by learning about array instantiation and arrays of objects, you gain powerful tools for structuring and processing the intricate datasets commonly encountered in astrophysics. This knowledge aids significantly in data analysis, enabling more efficient computations and the development of simulations that model astronomical phenomena.

#### Class Methods vs. Instance Methods <a href="#class-methods-vs-instance-methods" id="class-methods-vs-instance-methods"></a>

Java allows us to define two types of methods:

* Class methods, a.k.a. static methods.
* Instance methods, a.k.a. non-static methods.

Instance methods are actions that can be taken only by a specific instance of a class. Static methods are actions that are taken by the class itself. Both are useful in different circumstances. As an example of a static method, the `Math` class provides a `sqrt` method. Because it is static, we can call it as follows:

```java
x = Math.sqrt(100);
```

If `sqrt` had been an instance method, we would have instead the awkward syntax below. Luckily `sqrt` is a static method so we don't have to do this in real programs.

```java
Math m = new Math();
x = m.sqrt(100);
```

Sometimes, it makes sense to have a class with both instance and static methods. For example, suppose we want the ability to compare two stars. One way to do this is to add a static method for comparing Stars.

```java
public static Star brightestStar(Star s1, Star s2) {
    if (s1.luminosity > s2.luminosity) {
        return s1;
    }
    return s2;
}
```

This method could be invoked by, for example:

```java
Star s = new Star(2.0);
Star s2 = new Star(10.0);
Star.brightestStar(s, s2);
```

Observe that we've invoked using the class name, since this method is a static method.

We could also have implemented `brightestStar` as a non-static method, e.g.

```java
public Star brightestStar(Star s2) {
    if (this.luminosity > s2.luminosity) {
        return this;
    }
    return s2;
}
```

Above, we use the keyword `this` to refer to the current object. This method could be invoked, for example, with:

```java
Star s = new Star(2.0);
Star s2 = new Star(10.0);
s.brightestStar(s2);
```

Here, we invoke the method using a specific instance variable.

**Exercise 1.2.1**: What would the following method do? If you're not sure, try it out.

```java
public static Star brightestStar(Star s1, Star s2) {
    if (luminosity > s2.luminosity) {
        return this;
    }
    return s2;
}
```

**Static Variables**

It is occasionally useful for classes to have static variables. These are properties inherent to the class itself, rather than the instance. For example, we might record that the average surface temperature of a "Main Sequence Star" is 5800 Kelvin:

```java
public class Star {
    public double luminosity;
    public static double averageTemperature = 5800;
    ...
}
```

Static variables should be accessed using the name of the class rather than a specific instance, e.g. you should use `Star.averageTemperature`, not `s.averageTemperature`.

While Java technically allows you to access a static variable using an instance name, it is bad style, confusing, and in my opinion an error by the Java designers.

Think of a class method and an instance method like two kinds of telescopes we use in astrophysics. 

An instance method is like a personal telescope that you as an individual astronomer use to explore the universe. Just how you might adjust the focus, angle, or lens settings based on your location or sighting preferences, instance methods operate on a specific instance of a class and have access to the instance-specific data. Each telescope (or instance) might show a different view of the sky because each is pointed at different coordinates or has different settings, similar to how each instance method can act on unique instance data and attributes.

On the other hand, a class method is like a large radio telescope array shared by the entire astrophysics community that can be remotely accessed and used by anyone. These telescopes aren’t focused on the specific, localized settings but rather on broader, universal phenomena that are processable at a higher level. Class methods are associated with the class itself rather than any specific instance, allowing them to operate as more general tools for processing or generating data that might be applicable broadly across instances, such as analyzing statistical patterns in a large set of astronomical data.

In essence, instance methods allow you to dive deep into specific scenarios or objects (like how individual stars are composed of different elements), while class methods help you manage or analyze data at a broader scope (like the average characteristics of a galaxy). In computer science, just like in astrophysics, both views—focused and broad—are essential to develop a comprehensive understanding.

#### Class Methods vs. Instance Methods <a href="#class-methods-vs-instance-methods" id="class-methods-vs-instance-methods"></a>

        return s1;
    }
    return s2;
}
```

This method could be invoked by, for example:

```java
Star s = new Star(2.0);
Star s2 = new Star(10.0);
Star.brightestStar(s, s2);
```

Observe that we've invoked using the class name, since this method is a static method.

    }
    return s2;
}
```

```java
Star s = new Star(2.0);
Star s2 = new Star(10.0);
s.brightestStar(s2);
```

Imagine you're studying galaxies and want to understand the behavior of a particular star within them. Each galaxy in our universe can be thought of as a class, which is a blueprint for creating specific objects such as stars or star clusters with unique properties. Each star, or instance of that class, has shared characteristics with other stars, like composition or luminosity. However, some properties, like the speed of light or gravitational constant, remain the same across all galaxies and their stars. This is akin to what static variables represent in coding.

In computer science, static variables are akin to those universal constants. Static variables are part of the class, not a particular instance (or object) of a class. This means all objects of that class share the same static variables. They hold the same value for every object, no matter how many times the class is instantiated. 

Think of it like the consistent rules of physics that apply to all stars. The gravitational constant doesn't change just because you're studying a different star. Similarly, static variables ensure that some values remain consistent and accessible regardless of which object or instance you are analyzing. So, when you're coding and you want to define a property that should be uniform across all instances of a class, you would use a static variable.

Understanding static variables can help you think about certain astrophysical constants and rules that apply universally, providing a shared framework within which individual stars and galaxies operate, much like static variables govern certain behaviors uniformly across all instances within a program.

# 2. Defining and Using Classes

If you do not have prior Java experience, we recommend that you work through the exercises in [HW0](http://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/hw/hw0/hw0.html) before reading this chapter. It will cover various syntax issues that we will not discuss in the book.

#### Static vs. Non-Static Methods <a href="#static-vs-non-static-methods" id="static-vs-non-static-methods"></a>

**Static Methods**

All code in Java must be part of a class (or something similar to a class, which we'll learn about later). Most code is written inside of methods. Let's consider an example from the realm of astrophysics:

```java
public class Star {
    public static void emitLight() {
        System.out.println("Shine Bright!");
    }
}
```

If we try running the `Star` class, we'll simply get an error message:

```
$ java Star
Error: Main method not found in class Star, please define the main method as:
       public static void main(String[] args)
```

The `Star` class we've defined doesn't do anything on its own. We've simply defined something that a `Star` **can** do, namely emit light. To actually run the class, we'd either need to add a main method to the `Star` class, as we saw in chapter 1.1, or we could create a separate [`StarLauncher`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-LE-jJQLTM) class that runs methods from the `Star` class. For example, consider the program below:

```java
public class StarLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star.emitLight();
    }
}
```

```
$ java StarLauncher
Shine Bright!
```

A class that uses another class is sometimes called a "client" of that class, i.e. `StarLauncher` is a client of `Star`. Neither of the two techniques is better: Adding a main method to `Star` may be better in some situations, and creating a client class like `StarLauncher` may be better in others. The relative advantages of each approach will become clear as we gain additional practice throughout the course.

Imagine you're preparing for a space expedition, and on board your spacecraft, you have a control panel filled with buttons. Not every button is meant for every task; some are specifically designed to be used only when certain types of data are available or when specific crew members are present. Similarly, in computer programming, particularly in Java, we have methods or functions that can be compared to these buttons, designed to perform particular tasks.

The phrase `public static void main(String[] args)` is like the master button for launching a spacecraft's mission in a Java program. Let's break it down to understand its significance, especially if you think of it like a spacecraft:

1. **public**: This keyword makes the `main` method accessible from anywhere, just like a critical launch button visible and usable by authorized personnel on a spacecraft.

2. **static**: Think of static as something universally available on the spacecraft, like the manual override function that can be utilized without needing to power up any other subsystem. In Java, this means the `main` method can be called without needing to create an instance of the class it's in.

3. **void**: This signifies that the method doesn't return any data, similar to pressing the launch button and not expecting the button to report back its status; instead, it initiates action.

4. **main**: This is the primary docking control. When Java runs your program, it looks for this exact control labeled `main` to kickstart everything, like when mission control initiates the primary sequence to reach orbit.

5. **String[] args**: This part allows data input, much like entering coordinates or flight parameters before launching. It’s there to give your method the flexibility to handle any pre-launch parameters needed to tailor your mission.

In essence, `public static void main(String[] args)` is the entry point to a Java program, the command station that orchestrates which subsystems of your software need to power up to perform the intended operations, just like how your spacecraft systems need precise synchronization for a successful mission launch.

#### public static void main(String\[] args) <a href="#public-static-void-mainstring-args" id="public-static-void-mainstring-args"></a>

With what we've learned so far, it's time to demystify the declaration we've been using for the main method. Breaking it into pieces, we have:

* `public`: So far, all of our methods start with this keyword.
* `static`: It is a static method, not associated with any particular instance.
* `void`: It has no return type.
* `main`: This is the name of the method.
* `String[] args`: This is a parameter that is passed to the main method.

**Command Line Arguments**

Since main is called by the Java interpreter itself rather than another Java class, it is the interpreter's job to supply these arguments. They refer usually to the command line arguments. For example, consider the program `ArgsDemo` below:

```java
public class ArgsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

This program prints out the 0th command line argument, e.g.

```
$ java ArgsDemo these are command line arguments
these
```

In the example above, `args` will be an array of Strings, where the entries are {"these", "are", "command", "line", "arguments"}.

**Summing Command Line Arguments**

**Exercise 1.2.3**: Try to write a program that sums up the command line arguments, assuming they are numbers. For a solution, see the webcast or the code provided on GitHub.

Imagine you're piloting a spacecraft exploring distant planets, each with its own set of specific conditions and behaviors. Similarly, when you're running programs on a computer, you can use command line arguments to tailor their execution just like adjusting the controls for a new planetary exploration mission.

In the realm of computer science, command line arguments are parameters that are passed to a program from the command line interface (CLI). Think of them as custom instructions you provide to your program before it launches, much like inputting coordinates or environmental conditions into your spacecraft's computer before it journeys to a new planet. These arguments allow you to modify how the program behaves without changing its code.

For example, let's consider a scenario from astrophysics where you're analyzing data from different space telescopes. One telescope might detect X-rays, while another observes in the infrared spectrum. By using command line arguments, you can instruct your data analysis program to process only the X-ray data or the infrared data without needing to rewrite the entire program each time.

The power of command line arguments lies in their flexibility and efficiency. They enable you to rerun programs under different conditions quickly, much like recalibrating instruments for different celestial phenomena. Just as adapting a spacecraft's instruments allows for diverse data collection without physical modifications, command line arguments let your software respond dynamically to your scientific needs.

#### Using Libraries <a href="#using-libraries" id="using-libraries"></a>

One of the most important skills as a programmer is knowing how to find and use existing libraries. In the vast universe of modern software development, it is often possible to save yourself tons of work and debugging by turning to the web for help.

In this course, you're welcome to do this, with the following caveats:

* Do not use libraries that we do not provide.
* Cite your sources.
* Do not search for solutions for specific homework or project problems.

For example, it's fine to search for "convert String integer Java". However, it is not OK to search for "Project 2048 Berkeley".

In computer science, using libraries is akin to leveraging the work of others to avoid reinventing the wheel, which is a concept you might find quite relatable in astrophysics.

Imagine you are an astrophysicist who has developed a robust mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of a galaxy. Now, if another researcher wants to use your model for a similar study, it would be inefficient for them to start from scratch. Instead, if you encapsulate your model’s functionality into a "library," others can easily incorporate your work into their projects, significantly saving time and effort.

Similarly, in the realm of computer programming, libraries are collections of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks. Instead of writing routines to handle complex operations like data processing or interfacing with hardware from the ground up, programmers can include libraries in their projects to quickly implement these functionalities. Libraries can cover diverse needs, from simple mathematical functions to complex machine learning algorithms, which can be extremely resourceful in handling large astrophysical datasets.

For instance, in astrophysics, you might often deal with massive amounts of data from telescopes and simulations. Libraries like NumPy and SciPy in Python provide efficient data structures and routines for numerical computations, which are invaluable for analyzing such data. They save the time and effort that would otherwise go into developing custom solutions for mathematical operations.

Moreover, libraries are not just about reusing code; they also embody decades of collective expertise and optimization. This is similar to how astronomers build upon years of previous research to understand cosmic phenomena better. Libraries provide tested and reliable code written by experts, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of your computational tasks.

Overall, using libraries in computer science is much like the collaborative nature of scientific research. It allows you to focus on developing new theories and experiments—whether that's in understanding the cosmos's mysteries or coding complex simulations—by standing on the shoulders of the collaborative genius of the past.
