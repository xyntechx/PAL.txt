### Astrophysical Application: Defining and Using Celestial Classes

In astrophysics, defining classes and objects in Java is a powerful way to model celestial bodies and simulate astronomical phenomena. By using object-oriented programming, we can represent planets, stars, galaxies, and even black holes with their respective properties and behaviors. Let's explore how to adopt Java programming concepts to create a representation of an astrophysical system.

#### Defining Celestial Classes

Consider a simple class that models a star. Stars, much like dogs in our previous example, have different properties such as mass, luminosity, and temperature. Here's how we could define a `Star` class in Java:

```java
public class Star {
    private double massInSolarMasses;
    private double luminosityInSolarUnits;
    private double temperatureInKelvin;

    public Star(double mass, double luminosity, double temperature) {
        this.massInSolarMasses = mass;
        this.luminosityInSolarUnits = luminosity;
        this.temperatureInKelvin = temperature;
    }

    public void shine() {
        System.out.println("The star shines with a luminosity of " + luminosityInSolarUnits + " solar units.");
    }
}
```

#### Instantiating and Using Star Objects

Below is an example of how to create instances of the `Star` class and invoke their methods. We consider a sequence of stars for a simulated galaxy:

```java
public class StarSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star sun = new Star(1.0, 1.0, 5778);
        sun.shine();

        Star sirius = new Star(2.02, 25.4, 9940);
        sirius.shine();
    }
}
```

This code snippet will result in:

```
The star shines with a luminosity of 1.0 solar units.
The star shines with a luminosity of 25.4 solar units.
```

#### Adding Static Methods to Celestial Classes

Much like dogs can be compared by their weight, stars can be compared by their mass or brightness. We might add a method to find the brighter star in a static context:

```java
public static Star brighterStar(Star s1, Star s2) {
    if (s1.luminosityInSolarUnits > s2.luminosityInSolarUnits) {
        return s1;
    }
    return s2;
}
```

#### Arrays of Celestial Bodies

Astrophysics often involves dealing with multiple celestial bodies at once. Arrays in Java can help simulate collections of stars, similar to clusters or galactic neighborhoods:

```java
public class GalaxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Star[] galaxy = new Star[3];
        galaxy[0] = new Star(1.0, 1.0, 5778); // Our Sun
        galaxy[1] = new Star(2.02, 25.4, 9940); // Sirius
        galaxy[2] = new Star(1.3, 5.2, 7200); // Arcturus

        for (Star s : galaxy) {
            s.shine();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion

By using Java to model astrophysical systems, we combine the solid principles of software engineering with the scientific concepts of astronomy, enabling the simulation of complex systems such as stellar evolution, planetary motion, and cosmological expansion in a structured and reusable manner. As you engage with Java programming, consider how these concepts can be extended to simulate larger astrophysical phenomena such as binary star systems or entire star clusters.
