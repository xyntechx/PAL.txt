Choice: B

Explanation:
Assistant B's chapter provides a more structured and clearer explanation of Java classes and methods using relatable astrophysical concepts. The content is segmented into clear sections with well-delineated examples and explanations, making it easier for someone new to CS but interested in astrophysics to follow along. The use of astrophysical analogies is consistent and effectively facilitates understanding. While Assistant A offers more detailed analogies, they tend to be more complex and can overshadow the core CS concepts, making it potentially confusing for someone new to programming. Therefore, Assistant B's chapter is more effective for learning the principles of Java programming for someone interested in astrophysics.
