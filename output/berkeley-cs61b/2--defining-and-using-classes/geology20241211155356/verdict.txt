Choice: B

Explanation:
Assistant B provides a clearer integration of geology and computer science concepts, making the explanations more accessible for someone with a geology background. The chapter is structured to introduce Java programming constructs gradually, using geology analogies that are easy to understand, such as comparing static methods to tectonic plate movements and instance methods to mineral-specific processes. The content is neatly organized, transitioning from static vs. non-static methods, through object instantiation, to using libraries, each section reinforcing the concepts with relevant geological metaphors. This makes it significantly easier for geology enthusiasts to grasp Java programming principles without feeling overwhelmed.
