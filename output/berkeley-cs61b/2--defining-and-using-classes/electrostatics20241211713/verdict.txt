Choice: B

Explanation:
Assistant B provides a more coherent and relatable analogy between electrostatics and Java programming. The chapter by Assistant B simplifies OOP concepts like classes, objects, static, and instance methods by directly linking them to electrostatics analogies, such as charge configurations and universal physics laws, which are intuitive for someone with an interest in electrostatics. The examples given are succinct and directly reinforce the explained concepts without diverging into excessive detail unrelated to the analogy. Additionally, the exercises encourage practical application and deepen understanding through engagement with the content, making it more effective for a beginner learning CS concepts through electrostatic parallels.
