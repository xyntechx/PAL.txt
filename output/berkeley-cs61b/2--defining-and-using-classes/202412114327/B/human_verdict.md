**On the structure of the textbook**:

I'm not sure why it introduces HashMaps, it was not in the original textbook. It also introduce advanced concepts like interfaces which was not introduced in the original textbook.

**On the analogies it made**: 

Again, far-fetched analogies:

```
In Java, static methods belong to the class rather than a specific object instance, serving a universal functionâ€”similar to how ionic bonds result in stable compounds.

These methods act upon data within an object, akin to how covalent bonds rely on shared electrons in molecules.
```

In general agent B now performs much worse than agent A, becuase the concept alignment and analogy accuracy is much poorer.
