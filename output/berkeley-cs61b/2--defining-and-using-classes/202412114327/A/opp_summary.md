The AI assistant transformed the CS textbook chapter into a chemistry-focused chapter, thoroughly discussing various chemistry concepts such as bonding, Lewis structures, and hybridization. While this approach was executed well in terms of chemistry content, it entirely removed the computer science concepts, therefore, deviating from the objective of explaining CS using chemistry analogies. I liked the detailed and accurate chemistry descriptions but disliked the complete omission of the reference chapter's computer science objectives and content.
