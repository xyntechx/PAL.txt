# Evaluation category: All CS concepts from the reference chapter have been accurately explained

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The modified chapter thoroughly covers all the core CS concepts from the reference chapter, including lists, reference types, parameter passing, and array handling. Key concepts such as the "Mystery of the Walrus" and the GRoE are also retained and explained accurately.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are sufficiently used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The biology concepts are well interwoven throughout the modified chapter, providing clear analogies for CS concepts. Examples include references to bee colonies for lists, DNA for bits, and cellular specialization for arrays, which help in drawing parallels between biology and CS.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are accurately used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The biological analogies used in the modified chapter are accurate and relevant to the CS concepts they are likened to. For instance, DNA is correctly used to explain bits and gene expression is paralleled with bit arrays effectively, maintaining biological validity.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts do not overshadow the CS concepts (the main subject to be taught is CS)

Score: 3/3

Feedback: While biological concepts are prominently featured, they serve to enhance understanding of CS concepts and do not overshadow them. The focus remains on explaining CS topics, with biology serving as a tool to aid comprehension, ensuring the chapter's primary subject matter remains computer science.
