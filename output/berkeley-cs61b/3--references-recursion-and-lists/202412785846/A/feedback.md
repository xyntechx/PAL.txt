# Evaluation category: All CS concepts from the reference chapter have been accurately explained

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The modified chapter accurately explains CS concepts such as lists, bits, variable declaration, and reference types, including recursion and parameter passing. The explanations maintain the integrity of the original CS topics.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are sufficiently used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The biology concepts are sufficiently used to illustrate the CS concepts, such as using DNA strands to explain lists and gene expression to explain bits. The analogies are consistent throughout and provide an added layer of understanding.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are accurately used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The biology concepts used in the chapter are accurately represented. For example, the analogy of DNA as a linked list with nucleotides is biologically sound, and gene expression is rightly compared to data representation.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts do not overshadow the CS concepts

Score: 2/3

Feedback: While the biology analogies are well-integrated, there are sections where the biological explanations become quite elaborate, slightly overshadowing the primary focus on CS concepts. However, they still largely contribute to understanding the CS topics.
