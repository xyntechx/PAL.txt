# Evaluation category: All CS concepts from the reference chapter have been accurately explained

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The modified chapter maintains all core CS concepts from the reference chapter. It explains dynamic data structures, reference behaviors, data storage, and linked lists accurately with suitable analogies to biology, ensuring that the main CS elements are retained.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are sufficiently used

Score: 2/3

Feedback: The biology concepts are incorporated as analogies and metaphors, such as citing genetic sequences to explain lists, DNA bases relating to binary representation, and gene expression principles in referencing and mutation. While it uses biological contexts, some CS concepts lack direct biological analogs, limiting their sufficiency.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts are accurately used

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The biology concepts used, such as genetic inheritance, DNA sequence manipulation, and cellular storage, are accurate and appropriately parallel the CS concepts they are intended to represent. The connections drawn between the fields are valid and informative.

# Evaluation category: The biology concepts do not overshadow the CS concepts (the main subject to be taught is CS)

Score: 3/3

Feedback: The modified chapter effectively uses biology as a supplementary tool to explain CS concepts but ensures that CS remains the primary focus. The educational goal of understanding CS is upheld, and biological analogies serve to enhance, not overshadow, the CS teachings.
