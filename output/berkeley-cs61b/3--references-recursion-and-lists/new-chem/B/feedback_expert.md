1. **Chemical Equations and Reactions**: Ensure that all chemical equations are balanced and consistent. Consider providing explanations on the conservation of mass during a reaction and how balancing equations adheres to this law.

2. **Chemical Terminology**: For terms like "moles" and "stoichiometry," more context or examples would be beneficial to clarify these concepts for beginner students.

3. **CS Algorithms Involving Chemistry**: The chapter briefly mentions using algorithms to predict reaction outcomes but lacks depth. Consider including a section that introduces basic algorithms or models used in predicting chemical properties or reactions, such as machine learning approaches in computational chemistry.

4. **Code Examples and Syntax**: The code snippets provided need more detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part, especially if they are used to model chemical reactions or properties.

5. **Integration of Chemistry and CS Concepts**: Clarify how computational simulations can aid in predicting the behavior of chemical systems. Provide a simple example of a computational chemistry problem solved by a code, potentially comparing deterministic vs. probabilistic methods.

6. **CS Data Structures for Chemistry**: Discuss briefly about data structures (like graphs) and how they can be used in molecular modeling, representing molecules as nodes and bonds as edges.
