The chapter provided a fundamental overview, but I would appreciate more explicit connections to real-world applications in chemistry to better grasp the relevance of computer science concepts. Incorporating examples of how CS is used in chemistry, such as in molecular modeling or data analysis, would greatly enhance understanding. Additionally, including more visual aids or diagrams related to CS topics could help clarify complex concepts much like how they are used in chemistry texts.
